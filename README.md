## **Introduction**
This project is my attempt at Task 2 of the Python Developer internship at LetsGrowMore. The goal is to create a Snake game using Python. The approach taken for this task is creating an interactive window with all of the general features a video game typically has (a main menu, gameplay mechanics and a printed score).

## **Details**
* **<u>Project Title:</u>** *Create a Snake Game using Python*
* **<u>Project Description:</u>** With older Nokia phones, we had an old-age addiction with the snake game. But of course, we donâ€™t have it anymore. What if you could write one for yourself using Python? Beginner Python programmers who are interested in making something easier in their domain can definitely try this out, and the module `turle` was built specifically for beginners to try and submit as part of the project. The project will be done in Python 3.
* **<u>Project Submission:</u>** All of the work to be evaluated for this project is found in the main folder in the current directory.
* **<u>Libraries Used:</u>** The following libraries were used for the stated purposes:
  - `sys`, for exiting windows;
  - `random`, for generating random numbers, and;
  - `pygame`, for building the game and its contents.
